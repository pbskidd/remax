            <h2>A Partnership That Matters</h2>
            <div class="explanation-content">
                <p>Ecuadane is excited to share something special with the RE/MAX community. At Ecuadane, we deeply admire RE/MAX's commitment to the Children's Miracle Network, and we want to help amplify that impact. Our Give More program creates a powerful synergy between your closing gifts and your philanthropic values, allowing you to extend your positive influence beyond the immediate transaction.</p>
                
                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p>Starting today, every time a RE/MAX agent purchases one of our luxury blankets—whether it's a stock throw, a RE/MAX exclusive design, or a fully custom gift—we'll donate a full-priced blanket to a child in the Children's Miracle Network. That's right: one blanket for you, one gifted to provide comfort and security to a deserving child.</p>
                
                <h3>Beyond One-for-One</h3>
                <p>Regardless of your RE/MAX discount on what you buy, this donation is based on the full retail value of the gift. It's even more than a one-for-one deal—it's our way of standing beside you in the incredible work you do, both for your clients and your community. This generous approach ensures maximum impact for children in need while maintaining the exceptional quality of your client gifts.</p>

                    <h3>Comfort in Challenging Times</h3>
                    <p>The blankets donated through the Give More program provide more than just physical warmth—they offer emotional comfort to children facing medical challenges. Hospital environments can be intimidating for young patients, but having a soft, beautiful blanket of their own creates a sense of security and normalcy during difficult times. Your participation in this program helps transform the hospital experience for these children.</p>

                    <h3>RE/MAX's Legacy of Giving</h3>
                    <p>Since 1992, RE/MAX agents have donated more than $185 million to Children's Miracle Network Hospitals. The Give More program builds upon this incredible legacy, providing a new avenue for agents to contribute while also enhancing their business through meaningful client gifts. This dual-purpose approach aligns perfectly with RE/MAX's values of professional excellence and community service.</p>
